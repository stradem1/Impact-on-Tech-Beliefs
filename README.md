# SOC-302-Final-Paper
This is my replication package for my SOC 302 final project. I researched the relationship between each of the specified 6 different variables and one's beliefs about technology. The goal of this research was to find potential causes that predict one's beliefs about technology. 
# Instructions
My script can be accessed for use under the "Strader-tech_beliefs.R" file. This is the code that was used for research. The dataset can be found under "Table 1 - Descriptive Statistics" and "Data and Methods".
